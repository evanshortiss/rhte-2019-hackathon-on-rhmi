= RHTE 2019 RHMI Hackathon

Welcome to the RHTE 2019 Red Hat Managed Integration Hackathon!

Red Hat Managed Integration (RHMI) delivers cloud-based agile integration services hosted on OpenShift Dedicated (OSD). Using RHMI we can create consistent, immediately available, managed environments so that development teams can more easily build enterprise applications on OpenShift.
These environments accelerate engagement timelines, reduce operational risk and cost, and address the needs of the evolving enterprise integration market.

In this hackathon youâ€™re tasked with building out a real-time IoT traffic and parking meter management solution for the city of Los Angeles. Attendees will form teams of 4 people and will self organise to complete the following tasks:

* Data ingestion of real time traffic and parking meter data from AMQ Streams into a Postgres Database using Red Hat Fuse Online
* Definition of an OpenAPI compatible API Spec using Apicurio
* Implementation of this API using your choice of Runtime technologies - Fuse, Spring Boot, Vert.x or Node.js
* Protection of the API using 3scale API Management
* Visualisation of the data from the API via a front end web app based on React.js and Patternfly.js

{blank}

To get you started, you will be provided with the following infrastructure:

* An AMQ Streams instance with 2 topics - {streams-junction-topic-name} and {streams-meter-topic-name}. These topics will be connected to a live stream of IoT data which needs to be ingested
* A PostgreSQL server with two databases:
- A pre populated Lookup database containing reference data which maps incoming Ids for traffic junctions and parking meters to their corresponding names and geo locations
- An empty database, with pre defined schemas for storing the live IoT traffic and sensor data
* Access to the Apicurio API designer tool for creating the OPenAPI Spec compatible API definition
* Outline reference implementations of the API Server in Fuse, Spring Boot, Vert.x and Node.js which will have a single API definition implemented and connectivity to Postgres pre-configured
* Access to 3scale API Management service for protecting your API
* Outline reference implementations of the front end web app with a single API call implemented

{blank}

The architecture diagram below provides an overview of the complete solution and highlights what infrastructure is provided and which parts need to be implemented as part of this Hackaton.

== API Definition using Apicurio

Apicurito is the Red Hat API Designer tool that provides the abaility to create an *OpenAPI Specification* compatible API definitions.
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
For more information on the *OpenAPI Specification* see the link:{oas3-url}[Open API Specification, window="_blank"] on GitHub

In this section we will use the Red Hat API designer to create an OpenAPI Specification which will then be used to bootstrap the development of our API Server.
The APIs created should combine data from the provided Lookup Tables - *{postgres-junction-lookup-table}* and *{postgres-meter-lookup-table}* - with the data from the live junction and meter tables which is being injested from AMQ Streams.

=== Database Table Schemas

The schemas for each of the available database table are provided below.
These should be used as a reference to better understand the underlying data storage layout when desiging the APIs.

*{postgres-meter-lookup-table}*

This table stores the lookup data for parking meters.

----
  Column   |  Type
-----------+---------
 id        | integer
 address   | text
 latitude  | real
 longitude | real
----

*{postgres-junction-lookup-table}*

This table stores the lookup data for junctions.

----
    Column     |  Type
---------------+---------
 id            | integer
 junction_name | text
 latitude      | real
 longitude     | real
----

*{postgres-meter-status-table}*

This table stores the live information on meter status.

----
   Column    |  Type
-------------+---------
 id          | integer
 meter_id    | integer
 status_text | text
----

*{postgres-junction-status-table}*

This table stores the live information on junction traffic flow.

----
    Column   |  Type
-------------+---------
 id          | integer
 junction_id | integer
 count_ns    | integer
 count_ew    | integer
----


=== API Data Types
You will need to create at least two main API Data Types - *Junction* and *Meter*.
These Data Types form the basis for the APIs which will be created to act upon the data types.
For more information on *Data Types* see the link:{oas3-data-types-url}[Open API Spec Data Types Documentation]

. Log in to the link:{apicurito-url}[Red Hat API Designer, window="_blank"] console.
. Click the *New API* Button
. Click the *Add a data type* link on the left of the screen under the *Data Types* heading
. Enter the value of `Meter` in the *Name* field
. Enter the following vale for *JSON Example*
+
----
{
  "meter_id": "Integer",
  "last_updated": "Timestamp",
  "address": "String",
  "latitude": "Float",
  "longitude": "Float",
  "status": "String"
}
----
. Click the *REST Resource* box to create default REST resources for the Meter data type
. Click *Save*

Repeat the above steps to add a Data Type for *Junction*, providing an appropriate value for the *JSON Example* field.

=== API Paths
The specifics of the various API paths and their payloads has been left as a design decision for you.
Some sample API Paths and payloads are provided below as examples.
You should be guided by, but not feel tied to, these examples.

==== GET /realtime/parking/meters
Should return information for parking meters.
Should support an optional `status` query parameter to filer the list of meters based on their status.

----
[
  {
    "meter_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "address": String,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,

    // Can be "available", "occupied", "unknown", or "out-of-service"
    "status": String
  },
  {
    "meter_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "address": String,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,

    // Can be "available", "occupied", "unknown", or "out-of-service"
    "status": String
  },
  // etc.
}
----

=== GET /realtime/parking/meters/{meter-id}
Should return the latest live information for the given parking `meter-id`.

```js
{
  "meter_id": Integer,
  "last_updated": Timestamp,

  "latitude": Float,
  "longitude": Float,

  // Can be "available", "occupied", "unknown", or "out-of-service"
  "status": String
}
```

=== GET /realtime/traffic/junctions/{junction-id}
Should return latest conditions for the given junction:

----
{
  "junction_id": Integer,
  "last_updated": Timestamp,
  "prev_east_west_count": Integer,
  "prev_north_south_count": Integer,
  "24_hr_total_north_south_count": Integer,
  "24_hr_total_east_west_count": Integer
}
----

=== GET /realtime/traffic/junctions
Should return information for all junctions:

----
[
  {
    "junction_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,
    "count_ns": Integer,
    "count_ew": Integer
  },
  {
    "junction_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,
    "count_ns": Integer,
    "count_ew": Integer
  },
  // etc.
]
----

=== Download the completed OpenAPI Specification

Once you have fully defined the API specification, click *Generate* => *Fuse Camel Project*
You should also download the specification in either JSON or YAML format for use in the next section, if you wish to implement the API in a technology other than *Fuse Camel*.


[time=90]
== API Implementation



=== Connecting to Postgres

You have been given access to a Postgres database that contains lookup and live data for the traffic
junctions and parking meters.

Use the following details to connect:

. Username: `{postgres-username}`
. Password: `{postgres-password}`
. Hostname: `{postgres-hostname}`
. Database: `{postgres-database}`
. Port: `{postgres-port}`

Details of table names and schemas were provided in the previous section - *API Definition using Apicurio*



[time=30]
== API Protection using 3scale API Management


[time=90]
== Front end visualisation using React and Patternfly 4

In this section you will use Patternfly's React components to create a web
application to display the latest parking meter and junction traffic
information. PatternFly is an open source design system created to enable
consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases.

For the Parking Meters page you will:

. Display a Google Map
. Render a map marker for each meter
. Cluster the meters when the map is zoomed out
. Support filters for each meter state, e.g show only "available" parking meters

{empty} +

For the Traffic Junctions page you will:

. Display a Google Map
. Use Heatmap functionality from Google Maps to render traffic conditions

{empty} +

The end result will look similar to the images below. Here's an example of the
Parking Meters being displayed:

{empty} +

image::images/ui-parking-meters.png[role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

And here's the traffic heatmap built using the junction data

.. In the *Projects* section click *Add or Import Project*
.. Choose *GitHub*, and authenticate if necessary by clicking the *Connect your github account* button.
.. Once your accounts and organisations find the repository you created a few moments ago and check the box next to it in the list.
.. Click the blue *Add* button
.. Click the green *Create & Open* button to start the Workspace.
. After a minute or two you should be able to see the workspace UI.

[type=verification]
Is the CodeReady Workspace loaded with a folder containing your code from GitHub on the left?

[type=verificationFail]
Try running the steps again. Contact your administrator if it continues to fail.

=== Running the Frontend in CodeReady Workspaces

. In the top menu of the CodeReady Workspace UI click the blue *Run* arrow, then click the *newCustom* item that appears in a dropdown.
. The create command dialog and input fields will be displayed:
.. Enter `Serve` in the *Name* field.
.. In the *Command Line* field enter the following command. This will install `yarn` if it's not found then use it to install your dependencies and start the development server:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ${current.project.path} && (which yarn || npm i -g yarn) && yarn && yarn start:dev
----
.. Set *Applicable* to *Yes*
.. Click the *Macros* above the *Preview URL* field and choose the `${server.9000/tcp}` option.
.. Click *Save* and wait until the *Manage commands* panel on the left lists your *Serve* command.
. Switch back to the source code tree to setup the Google Maps API Key environment variable:
.. In the top menu select *Project > Show/Hide Hidden Files*.
.. Using the top menu again, select *Project > New > File*.
.. Name the file _.env_ when prompted.
.. Open the _.env.example_ file and copy the contents into your new _.env_ file. Ask you administrator for a Google Maps API Key or create a Project on link:https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard[Google APIs] and create your own API Key.
. Run the development server by clicking the blue *Run* arrow again, but this time choosing the newly listed *Serve* option.
. Wait yarn to install the application dependencies and build, then click the URL printed with the prefix *preview* in the terminal output.


[type=verification]
Open your Preview URL from CodeReady Workspaces. You should see a UI with links for Traffic and Parking Maps.

[type=verificationFail]
Verify no errors are being printed by the Serve command and that your followed each step above correctly. If no map is displayed, but the links are then you need to verify your Google Maps API Key.


=== Displaying a Traffic Heatmap
