= RHTE 2019 RHMI Hackathon

Welcome to the RHTE 2019 Red Hat Managed Integration Hackathon!

Red Hat Managed Integration (RHMI) delivers cloud-based agile integration services hosted on OpenShift Dedicated (OSD). Using RHMI we can create consistent, immediately available, managed environments so that development teams can more easily build enterprise applications on OpenShift.
These environments accelerate engagement timelines, reduce operational risk and cost, and address the needs of the evolving enterprise integration market.

In this hackathon youâ€™re tasked with building out a real-time IoT traffic and parking meter management solution for the city of Los Angeles. Attendees will form teams of 4 people and will self organise to complete the following tasks:

* Data ingestion of real time traffic and parking meter data from AMQ Streams into a Postgres Database using Red Hat Fuse Online
* Definition of an OpenAPI compatible API Spec using Apicurio
* Implementation of this API using your choice of Runtime technologies - Fuse, Spring Boot, Vert.x or Node.js
* Protection of the API using 3scale API Management
* Visualisation of the data from the API via a front end web app based on React.js and Patternfly.js

{blank}

To get you started, you will be provided with the following infrastructure:

* An AMQ Streams instance with 2 topics - `junctions` and `meters`. These topics will be connected to a live stream of IoT data which needs to be ingested
* A PostgreSQL server with two databases:
- A pre populated Lookup database containing reference data which maps incoming Ids for traffic junctions and parking meters to their corresponding names and geo locations
- An empty database, with pre defined schemas for storing the live IoT traffic and sensor data
* Access to the Apicurio API designer tool for creating the OPenAPI Spec compatible API definition
* Outline reference implementations of the API Server in Fuse, Spring Boot, Vert.x and Node.js which will have a single API definition implemented and connectivity to Postgres pre-configured
* Access to 3scale API Management service for protecting your API
* Outline reference implementations of the front end web app with a single API call implemented

{blank}

The architecture diagram below provides an overview of the complete solution and highlights what infrastructure is provided and which parts need to be implemented as part of this Hackaton.

== Data Ingestion from AMQ Streams to Postgres using Fuse Online

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as AMQ Streams and Postgres.
In this section we will create two connection - one to AMQ Streams and one to Postgres.
We will then create an integration that uses these two connections and translates incoming data from AMQ streams into database insert statements on Postgres.

=== Creating the AMQ Streams Connector

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console.

. Select *Connections* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create Connection* button to start the *Create Connection* wizard.

. When prompted with *Select Connector*, select *Kafka Message Broker*.

. When prompted with *Configure connection*:
.. Enter the following in the *Kafka Broker URIs* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{kafka-broker-uri}
----
.. Click the Validate button to ensure the connection to AMQ Streams is configured correctly.
.. You should see the message `Kafka Message Broker has been successfully validated`.
.. Click Next to move onto the *Name connection* step

. When prompted with *Name connection*:
.. Enter the following in the *Name* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----

. Click *Save*.


[type=verification]
Is the new AMQ Streams connection displayed on the *Connections* screen of the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="{context}-4"] console?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.


=== Creating the Postgres Connector

To allow Fuse Online to store data consumed from AMQ Streams, we need to create a new Database connection in Red Hat Fuse Online.

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console.

. Select *Connections* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create Connection* button to start the *Create Connection* wizard.

== API Definition using Apicurio

Apicurito is the Red Hat API Designer tool that provides the abaility to create an *OpenAPI Specification* compatible API definitions.
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
For more information on the *OpenAPI Specification* see the link:{oas3-url}[Open API Specification, window="_blank"] on GitHub

In this section we will use the Red Hat API designer to create an OpenAPI Specification which will then be used to bootstrap the development of our API Server.
The APIs created should combine data from the provided Lookup Tables - *{postgres-junction-lookup-table}* and *{postgres-meter-lookup-table}* - with the data from the live junction and meter tables which is being injested from AMQ Streams.

=== Database Table Schemas

The schemas for each of the available database table are provided below.
These should be used as a reference to better understand the underlying data storage layout when desiging the APIs.

*{postgres-meter-lookup-table}*

This table stores the lookup data for parking meters.

----
  Column   |  Type
-----------+---------
 id        | integer
 address   | text
 latitude  | real
 longitude | real
----

*{postgres-junction-lookup-table}*

This table stores the lookup data for junctions.

----
    Column     |  Type
---------------+---------
 id            | integer
 junction_name | text
 latitude      | real
 longitude     | real
----

*{postgres-meter-status-table}*

This table stores the live information on meter status.

----
   Column    |  Type
-------------+---------
 id          | integer
 meter_id    | integer
 status_text | text
----

*{postgres-junction-status-table}*

This table stores the live information on junction traffic flow.

----
    Column   |  Type
-------------+---------
 id          | integer
 junction_id | integer
 count_ns    | integer
 count_ew    | integer
----


=== API Data Types
You will need to create at least two main API Data Types - *Junction* and *Meter*.
These Data Types form the basis for the APIs which will be created to act upon the data types.
For more information on *Data Types* see the link:{oas3-data-types-url}[Open API Spec Data Types Documentation]

. Log in to the link:{apicurito-url}[Red Hat API Designer, window="_blank"] console.
. Click the *New API* Button
. Click the *Add a data type* link on the left of the screen under the *Data Types* heading
. Enter the value of `Meter` in the *Name* field
. Enter the following vale for *JSON Example*
+
----
{
  "meter_id": "Integer",
  "last_updated": "Timestamp",
  "address": "String",
  "latitude": "Float",
  "longitude": "Float",
  "status": "String"
}
----
. Click the *REST Resource* box to create default REST resources for the Meter data type
. Click *Save*

Repeat the above steps to add a Data Type for *Junction*, providing an appropriate value for the *JSON Example* field.

=== API Paths
The specifics of the various API paths and their payloads has been left as a design decision for you.
Some sample API Paths and payloads are provided below as examples.
You should be guided by, but not feel tied to, these examples.

==== GET /realtime/parking/meters
Should return information for parking meters.
Should support an optional `status` query parameter to filer the list of meters based on their status.

```js
[
  {
    "meter_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "address": String,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,

    // Can be "available", "occupied", "unknown", or "out-of-service"
    "status": String
  },
  {
    "meter_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "address": String,
    "latitude": Float,

    "status": String
  },
  // etc.
}
```

### GET /realtime/parking/meters/{meter-id}
Should return the latest live information for the given parking `meter-id`.

```js
{
  "meter_id": Integer,

  "longitude": Float,

  // Can be "available", "occupied", "unknown", or "out-of-service"
  "status": String
}
```

### GET /realtime/traffic/junctions/{junction-id}
Should return latest conditions for the given junction:

```js
{
  "junction_id": Integer,
  "last_updated": Timestamp,
  "prev_east_west_count": Integer,
  "prev_north_south_count": Integer,
  "24_hr_total_north_south_count": Integer,
  "24_hr_total_east_west_count": Integer
}
```

### GET /realtime/traffic/junctions
Should return information for all junctions:

```js
[
  {
    "junction_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,
    "count_ns": Integer,
    "count_ew": Integer
  },
  {
    "junction_id": Integer,
    "last_updated": Timestamp,
    "latitude": Float,
    "longitude": Float,
    "count_ns": Integer,
    "count_ew": Integer
  },
  // etc.
]
```

=== Download the completed OpenAPI Specification
